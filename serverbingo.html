    <p> Thanks for becoming a member of our Patreon! Allow us to entertain you for the duration of your shift. As we've all probably accompanied many an elderly relative, we assume you're familiar with the rules of Bingo. Should any of these occurances befall you, simply click the boxes as you go about your day at work. Once you have five in a vertical or horizontal row, take a screenshot of your bingo card, post it to your Instagram stories, and tag us @shiftdrinkscomedy! <br><br>No one should have to endure this kind of bullshit on a regular basis, and we'll help you make the most of it.<br><br>Please contact us with more suggestions to put on more bingo games so we can change it up every month or so.
