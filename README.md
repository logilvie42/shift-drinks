Putting my rudimentary web dev skills to decent use

I'm currently designing a small website for Shift Drinks Comedy, my sketch comedy group! We have a few videos that have gotten over a million views on Facebook and I'm hoping to grow our internet representation with our own website. I'm super excited that I've made this with my brainscape.

I can only hope it looks good on mobile eventually. But isn't that what everyone hopes?!
